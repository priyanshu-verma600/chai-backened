/*    // important points.
 Meaning:
avatar is a required field in your user profile.

It stores a URL string pointing to the profile picture of the user.

This image is usually uploaded to a cloud-based image hosting service, like Cloudinary, and the returned URL is saved in this field.

üß† Real-World Example:
Imagine you are signing up for a platform like Twitter or Instagram:

The signup form asks you to upload a profile picture (your face or logo).

You upload the image.

Your backend uses Cloudinary (or similar service) to store the image online.

Cloudinary gives a URL like:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://res.cloudinary.com/myapp/image/upload/v1687404739/profile_123.jpg
That URL gets saved in the avatar field of your User document.

So when someone views your profile, your app can show your profile picture using that URL.

üîπ What Is coverImage?
js
Copy
Edit
coverImage: {
  type: String // cloudinary url
}
‚úÖ Meaning:
coverImage is optional.

It also stores a URL to an image, just like avatar.

This image is usually shown as a banner or background at the top of your profile ‚Äî like in Facebook or Twitter.

üß† Real-World Example:
You visit someone‚Äôs Twitter profile:

You see their profile photo (avatar) in a circle.

Behind that is a large banner image across the top ‚Äî that‚Äôs the cover image.

When a user uploads this banner image:

It‚Äôs stored in Cloudinary.

Cloudinary gives a URL like:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://res.cloudinary.com/myapp/image/upload/v1687404972/banner_456.jpg
This gets saved in the coverImage field.

If a user doesn‚Äôt upload one, the value remains undefined or null, and the app might use a default background.

üìä Summary
Field	Purpose	Required?	Stored As
avatar	User's profile picture	‚úÖ Yes	String (URL to image)
coverImage	Optional profile banner/background	‚ùå No	String (URL to image)

üîß Why Use Cloudinary or Other Services?
When a user uploads an image:

You don‚Äôt want to store it directly in your server's filesystem (unsafe and not scalable).

Instead, you upload it to services like:

Cloudinary

Firebase Storage

AWS S3*/
